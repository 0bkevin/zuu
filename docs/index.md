I want to be able to send small donations to my favorite charities.
When someone makes a really good point on a podcast, I'd like to send them
a little token of appreciation sometimes. But, I'm not going to get my
wallet out and login to some website, type in my credit card number and
pay a
[2.9%](https://www.gofundme.com/c/pricing){:target="_blank"}
fee to be able to send someone a couple of bucks.
What a nightmare.
With free2z and
[Zcash](https://z.cash/){:target="_blank"},
I can zap anyone
[a note](https://electriccoin.co/blog/encrypted-memo-field/){:target="_blank"}
and some funds really easily with my
[mobile phone wallet](https://z.cash/wallets/){:target="_blank"}.

## Benefits for Creators

If you have a username/password combination on free2z, you are a Creator
and you can create a zPage in under 15 seconds.
You post your own address and people send funds directly to you.
Free2z has no way to identify you or monitor who is sending what funds
to whom.

* No Fees. 100% of donations go directly to you.
* Easy signup. No bank account or credit card needed.
* Private and anonymous, if desired
* Rich, powerful content without distractions
* Top-level name on free2z.com, free2z.cash and free2give.xyz

Creators can create zPages for free on free2z using rich
html-enabled
[markdown](https://medium.com/@itsjzt/beginner-guide-to-markdown-229adce30074){:target="_blank"}
including iframe embeds (eg YouTube Videos).

To prevent spam,
free2z requires a one-time donation of 0.01 [Zcash](https://z.cash) to
establish each zPage as "funded". The Creator of the zPage can send this
themselves or wait for the community to fund the page.
In most cases, pages will be funded within a few days.
Once the Creator or the community has funded the zPage for
0.01 [Zcash](https://z.cash){:target="_blank"},
they get a top-level name for their zPage, for example, in
[https://free2z.cash/python-zcash-rpc](https://free2z.cash/python-zcash-rpc){:target="_blank"},
the path component, `python-zcash-rpc`, is chosen by the creator.
They also get to turn on their peer-2-peer donation address.
