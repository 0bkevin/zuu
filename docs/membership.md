# Membership

There are three basic levels with which people can use Free2z.

## Unauthenticated User

An unauthenticated user can search and read public zPages,
can read private zPages that they have the url to, and can send funds
[and messages](https://electriccoin.co/blog/encrypted-memo-field/){:target="_blank"}
[<sup>1</sup>](https://zcash.readthedocs.io/en/latest/rtd_pages/memos.html){:target="_blank"}
to Creators with a
[Zcash wallet](https://z.cash/wallets/){:target="_blank"}
or by other means that Creators are free to describe in their content.

## New Creator

Once a User creates a username and password,
[a new zPage](what-are-zpages) will be created and the User
becomes a Creator.
The new Creator will start out _unfunded_.
The new Creator can send 0.01 to become a Funded Creator or wait to see
if the community will fund their idea.
If you have a cool idea or worthy project, the chances are very good
that the community will fund you. However, this could take an hour, a day,
a week, or a month.
The new Creator can create up to 3 zPages and wait for funding
from the funded community. To publish immediately, you can
fund your own page with 0.01 Zcash.

<!-- TODO link: fund your own page -->

## Funded Creator

Once you have a login and at least one of your zPages is funded with a
one-time donation, you are granted membership to Free2z which includes:

* Edit and fully publish your funded zPages
* Share zPages with unauthenticated users
* Create up to 10 unfunded zPages
* Access to basic features like comments, tagging, voting
* Browse unfunded zPages and fund them

A single funding provides lifetime free access to basic features on the site.
